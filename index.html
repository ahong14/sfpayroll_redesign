                                        Thank you for stopping by our site. The San Francisco Bay Area Chapter (SFBAC) of the American Payroll Association was formed in 1983 to provide educational and networking opportunities for local Payroll Professionals, as well as to support the goals of the National Organization. 

                                        Payroll is a demanding profession, and deserves to be recognized as such. Payroll Professionals are called upon to constantly update their education and skills, to produce work that conforms to the highest technical standards, and to maintain the highest level of professional ethics. 
                                            
                                        SFBAC holds regular meetings featuring speakers on topics ranging from taxation and regulation to personal and professional development. Continuing Education Units (CEUs) are available for all meetings. 
                                            
                                        In 2010, the Chapter provided a scholarship to attend the Annual APA Congress. We also awarded 3 scholarships to the California Payroll Conference. We intend to continue this scholarship program, so keep an eye out for announcements! 
                                            
                                        2003 was our 20th Anniversary year. We celebrated with a half-day meeting at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco , with special guest, Michael Hall, CPP, APA President-Elect.

                                        SFBAC conducts two annual study groups to help candidates prepare for the Certified Payroll Professional Exam. This exam is offered twice a year, in the Spring and Fall. The Chapter holds its eight weeks CPP Study Group in the spring and summer, beginning in February and July respectively, in time for candidates to take the Spring and Fall exam. The Facilitators are all CPPs and all volunteers. Professionals who are already CPPs can earn CEUs by facilitating or participating in the Study Group sessions. 
                                            
                                        New Payroll Practitioners not eligible to take the CPP Exam can take the recently established Fundamental Payroll Certification Exam. The CPP Study Group is also an excellent learning resource for this exam. 
                                            
                                        We hope to see you at one of our meetings in the near future. Please refer to our Calendar of Events. You can also apply for membership online, or look through the latest Job Postings we have received.
